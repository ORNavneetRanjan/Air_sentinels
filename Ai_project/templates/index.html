        Air quality monitoring and pollution control are critical aspects of environmental management in urban areas.
        This abstract highlights the development of a comprehensive system for air quality monitoring and pollution control leveraging machine learning techniques.
        The system integrates data from various sources, including air quality monitoring stations,
        weather stations, traffic management authorities, and industrial facilities,
        to assess pollution levels and identify sources of air contaminants.
        Through feature engineering and preprocessing, relevant features are extracted from the collected datasets to characterize air quality,
        meteorological conditions, traffic patterns, and industrial emissions.
        Machine learning algorithms are employed to predict pollutant concentrations, classify pollution sources,
        and recommend mitigation strategies such as emission controls, vehicle restrictions, and urban planning interventions.
        The system aims to provide real-time or near-real-time monitoring of air quality,
        enabling proactive measures to improve air quality and public health. By implementing this system, urban areas can effectively manage pollution levels,
        reduce environmental impacts, and promote sustainable development for the well-being of inhabitants and ecosystems.

      <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Humans can only survive because of air. Its quality must be monitored and understood for our wellbeing.
          Due to air pollution, millions of people around the world suffer from physiological disorders and respiratory death.
          According to scientific evidence, air pollution poses the single greatest environmental risk.
          Due to the toxic gas emissions caused by rapid industrialization, population levels have dramatically increased.
          Our health is suffering greatly as a result of the air being contaminated by hazardous substances.
          Due to this unchecked pollution, air quality has significantly declined. AQI is a numerical index used to measure and convey air pollution levels.
          The 12 parameters (air pollutants) used to calculate the AQI are NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), SO2 (sulfur dioxide),
          CO (carbon monoxide), O3 (ozone), PM10 (particulate matter having a diameter of 10 microns or less),
          PM2.5 (particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less), NH3 (ammonia), and benzene.
          In other applications, the six pollutants PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 are used to calculate the air quality index (AQI).
          However, the precise selection of contaminants relies on the particular aim and numerous variables, including data accessibility,
          measurement techniques, and monitoring frequency. A high AQI number indicates severely contaminated air,
          which can have a serious negative impact on health. Real-time air quality can be monitored using the AQI.
          Numerous weather stations have also captured daily and hourly AQI data in our own backyard.
          These data will be mined and harvested with the intention of using them in the suggested work.

      As a result, the dataset used contains records of the AQIs in various Indian cities.
          The three distinct regression analysis techniques will be put into practice,
          and the best accuracy will be determined through comparison.

        <h1>and Sample Data</h1>
        <p>
            The link to the dataset used for this work is given below.
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data">click here</a>
            This data is combined(across the years and states) and largely clean version of the Historical
            Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control
            Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).
            The dataset includes hourly and daily air quality and AQI (air quality index) data from numerous stations in
            several Indian cities. The data are for the years 2015 through 2020. The original dataset included 29532 rows
            and 16 columns, which included all the cities listed below. The cities are given below:
